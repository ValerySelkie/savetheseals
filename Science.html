            <p>A group of philosophy scientists from Oklahoma State University
            seem to have figured out what is the whole point of our existence as 
            human beings. Philosophy experts from all around the world call this 
            an international sensation and the most important discovery of the 
            century.</p>
            <p>Meet Brian Lolz. He is a philosophy master at Oklahoma State
            University and is dedicated to his career, as he says, exclusively
            and entirely. "I remember one time me, my wife and my seven kids 
            were short of money because my wage is 100$ lover than the minimum
            wage in this country, and my wife begged me to use the 40$ that we
            had left to buy some food for the children, but I told her: 'No,
            woman, I am spending it on a 600-page book about Plato's left foot!'.
            And so I did, because nothing can stand in the way of my
            intellectual fulfillment!" - says Brian with a smile. He later 
            admitted that his kids got taken away from him the next day by the 
            Child Protective Services. He didn't seem particularly happy about 
            it.</p>
            <p>Brian and his team of researchers have spent two years studying
            Plato's, Wolter's and Homer's works, conducting experiments on 
            cockroaches and chewing philosophical stones provided to them by 
            Montana Mythology Association, in search for an answer to one big
            question: What is the meaning of life? "We barely ate anything," - 
            admits Brian's colleague Peter Vicktem, - "Brian kept us in the room
            with doors locked, forcing us to physically and emotionally drain
            ourselves in the name of science. In the end Johnny [another 
            colleague] was so exhausted that he started chewing on my shoe 
            thinking it was an eggplant,". Many people from the university staff 
            complained about weird noises coming from the classroom at 3AM every 
            night. "They were chanting some kind of a weird song. - complains 
            Mike Schmidt, an Oklahoma State University night guard. - They 
            seemed to have been worshiping someone named Shaggy, but I'm not
            sure,".</p>
            <p>Today, months of research later, Brian and his team finally are
            proud to announce the result of their hard work. "The meaning of 
            life... - says Brian with fanatism written all over his face, - is
            ice-cream! The whole center of our existence, the goal of our lives 
            is finding the ice-cream type that is perfect for us. We spend our
            days tasting endless portions of this frozen dessert in search for 
            the true match, the one and only, the perfect one. And only once we
            find it we can become perfectly happy!".</p>
            <p>Brian's discovery has had a huge resonance in the public. "This 
            is the most genius thing I have ever heard! - exclaims Harold Smart,
            a president of Global Science Association. - Mr. Lolz should 
            absolutely be nominated for Nobel Prizes in all of the existing 
            sciences, all of my colleagues agree with me on this one!". 
            Governments of Sweden and France have shown their appreciation for
            the discovery by providing endless ice-cream coupons to all the 
            senior citizens of the countries and investing the government money
            into developing the ice-cream producing industry.</p>
